# Introduction to Cyber Security Testing IC00AI82

Exercises for the course **[Introduction to Cyber Security Testing IC00AI82](https://opas.peppi.oulu.fi/en/course/IC00AI82/32356)**. 

Upon completing the course, the student:
* is familiar with the basic concepts and the terminology of cyber security testing
* can use security testing tools
* is familiar with different challenges in the field of cyber security

The course is organized by Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG).

The exercises in this repository also contain some required theoretical material to understand some concepts. 

## Practicalities

The course has seven lectures, seven laboratory exercises, and seven Moodle mini-exams.

Moodle mini-exams are mostly based on the lectures.

To pass this course with grade **one**, you have to pass the Moodle mini-exams.

To get a better grade, you have to do some laboratory exercises.
You can somewhat decide what grade you will earn on this course!

All laboratory tasks are optional and total points from those will determine your grade.

## Grading

Upon completing the exercises, you can get up to **five** points every week, excluding possible bonus points.

Your grade is based on the following grading table.
For example, with 12 points you get grade 2.

Total Points|Total Grade
:-:|:-:
12+ | 2
18+ | 3
24+ | 4
30+ | 5

### Getting started

The submission of the basic technical tasks will be usually implemented as Moodle exams (different from weekly, mandatory mini-exams!).

There will be a collection of parametrised questions and you will get one randomly. 
You need to do something technical, and return the result, which will then be automatically reviewed.

**For advanced and essay-like tasks**, you are required to use a private GitHub repository, with weekly template folders. 

* Find a link from Moodle where you can receive and create a private GitHub repository containing all the return template folders. You are
expected to answer for given templates and store your actual work in this repository.
* Create a GitHub account, if you don't have one already, and create this private repository from the link.
* Complete as many tasks as you wish and update your repository accordingly. Check the grading table found in each lab instructions on what you have to complete to earn the grade of your choosing
* Push your changes to your repository before the deadline, and return the link to your repository to the corresponding
return box of the lab in Moodle.

Check the [cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) if you need a refresher on how
 to use Git.
Some basic commands below:

```bash
git add </path/filename>
git commit -m "<message>"
git push
```

### Laboratory environment

The course requires the usage of a Linux-based operating system.
You can use anything you want, but then you might need to figure out how to install some tools by yourself.
See more general information [here.](https://ouspg.org/resources/laboratories/)

We will provide custom Arch Linux as the pre-configured solution.
See Moodle workspace for download links.

More information about Arch Linux is available [here.](https://ouspg.org/resources/archlinux/)

## The usage of artificial intelligence when making the exercises

You are allowed, and even recommended to use trending LLMs (chatbots) for finding information. They can be particularly useful in explaining and generating some command-line interface commands, for example. Or for getting a high-level overview of some topics, when they can be very accurate. They are also good at generating formatted data.

* You are **not allowed** to use them as a reference. Find a real one. 
* You are **not allowed** to trust them blindly. Double-check what they say, if you are making strong statements or assumptions. 
* You are **not allowed** to copy their output directly to your written answers, especially in essays.
* You **are allowed** to use them for rephrasing, brainstorming, for grammar corrections, but please **mention if you do so**. 
* We **recommend including/exporting the chat history** for transparency if you have used it significantly. 
* Whenever you submit information (making a prompt, asking something), **remember that data is likely stored forever**, now owned by the platform owner and likely used to train the LLM further. 

Overall, LLMs can be very useful but one should not develop too high a dependency on them.
  * If you are new to programming language, get used to the standard library documentation or official book, and maybe later use the LLM.
  * If you are new to some CLI application, read the manual first and later use LLM to generate the commands.
  * If you are new to some technical protocol and intend to use it a lot, read the official introduction and maybe use LLM later.
  * The list goes on. You should always know where to find the original information.
